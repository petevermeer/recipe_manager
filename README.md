# recipe_manager
a place to store my recipes and make grocery lists

add recipe objects to the menu object and include (optional) a picture in the images file.

the picture needs to be:
- png
- sqaure (ish)
- have a file name that matches the recipe name

when you add ingredients to a recipe it helps to be consistent in how you name the section of the store you're visiting:

dry goods
meat
dairy
produce
bakery
